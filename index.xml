I then discovered that you can do the same thing with maps. The cubed Gnomonic projection is perfect for creating simple map cubes that kids can easily print, cut out, and assemble with a glue stick. We started making our own map cubes using NASA&amp;rsquo;s G.Projector software but quickly moved to creating our own tool using GeoTools and GeoScript.</description></item><item><title>Calculating Centroids with GeoScript Groovy</title><link>https://jericks.github.io/posts/geoscript-centroids/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 09:05:25 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jericks.github.io/posts/geoscript-centroids/</guid><description>&lt;p>GeoScript uses the GeoTools and Java Topology Suite libraries to provide easy-to-use scripting APIs with implementations in Python, JavaScript, Scala and Groovy. The GeoScript web site provides simple code snippets in all four languages to help you get started. In this post, I address a real world example: calculating centroids from one GIS layer and saving them to another layer using Groovy. This example highlights the GeoScript Layer, Feature, and Geometry modules.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://jericks.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 10:54:01 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jericks.github.io/projects/</guid><description>GeoScript Groovy GeoScript Groovy is the Groovy implementation of GeoScript. GeoScript is a geospatial scripting API for the JVM that contains one API and four implementations (Python, JavaScript, Scala, and Groovy).
GeoScript is built on the shoulders of giants and essentially wraps the Java Topology Suite and the GeoTools libraries.
GeoScript provides several modules that includes geometry, projection, features, layers, workspaces, styling and rendering.
Geometry Commands Geometry commands is a command line library for processing geometry that follows the unix philosophy.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://jericks.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 10:53:53 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jericks.github.io/about/</guid><description>I was born in North Dakota where I spent my childhood exploring the badlands. In college I majored in Archaeology and Classical Languages (Latin and Greek). During my summers, I was able to work as an archaeologist in North Dakota and Michigan after attending fields schools in Fargo and Greece. I continued my Archaeological education by attending graduate school at the University of Oregon where I studied Geoarchaeology and excavated a site on the Alaska Peninsula that led to my Master&amp;rsquo;s Thesis entitled &amp;ldquo;The Geoarchaeology of Nak-8&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Calculating Convex Hull and Minimum Bounding Circle with Groovy</title><link>https://jericks.github.io/posts/geoscript-convexhull/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:26:56 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jericks.github.io/posts/geoscript-convexhull/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Java Topology Suite, which Groovy GeoScript wraps, contains spatial operators that act on a group of Features or Geometries. In this post, I collect all geometries from a shapefile to calculate the convex hull and minimum bounding circle. This post builds on previous blog entries where I use GeoScript to extract centroids and buffer Features.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
